Abstract: Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeaccelerometer-XYZ and timegyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timebodyaccelerometer-XYZ and timegravityaccelerometer-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain jerk signals (timebodyaccelerometerjerk-XYZ and timebodygyroscopejerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timebodyaccelerometermagnitude, timegravityaccelerometermagnitude, timebodyaccelerometerjerkmagnitude, timebodygyroscopemagnitude, timebodygyroscopejerkmagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencybodyaccelerometer-XYZ, frequencybodyaccelerometerjerk-XYZ, frequencybodygyroscope-XYZ, frequencybodyaccelerometerjerkmagnitude, frequencybodygyroscopemagnitude, frequencybodygyroscopejerkmagnitude. (Note the 'frequency' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
